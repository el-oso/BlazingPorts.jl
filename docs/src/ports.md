# Ports: Rust vs Julia

Per-crate reports. Plots are violin distributions of per-evaluation time (lower = better),
single-thread, median annotated.

## memchr → `StringSearch` — ✅ beats the crate

Base's multi-byte `findfirst(needle, haystack)` is a scalar scan (0.12× `memchr::memmem`). We added the
SIMD pass Base never wrote: a **first+last-byte prefilter** over `Vec{64,UInt8}` (memmem's own trick) +
a bounded scalar tail.

- **Result:** parity-to-slight-beat — **1.03–1.10×** the `memmem` crate (both near the ~67 GB/s
  single-core bandwidth ceiling), and ~8–12× over Base `findfirst`.
- Byte search was already at parity (Base is memchr-backed), so only `m ≥ 2` takes the SIMD path.
- `@assert_vectorized` / `@assert_noalloc` / `@assert_typestable` green.

## itoa → `IntFormat` — ✅ beats the crate

The famous "8.7× gap" was a **dead-code-elimination artifact** — the Rust shim used only
`buf.format(x).len()`, so the optimizer elided itoa's digit-writes. Measured fairly (`black_box` /
`donotdelete`), itoa formats at ~7.5 ns/int, not 1.83.

- **Result:** **1.05×** on positive-only (pure format), **1.5×** on full mixed-sign `Int64`, ~2× on
  small numbers. ~3× faster than Base `string()` (which heap-allocates).
- Levers: divide-and-conquer digit extraction, jeaiii division-free 8-digit (verified), 16-bit packed
  LUT stores, and — the decisive one — **branchless sign** (`if x<0` mispredicts ~4× at 50/50 signs).

## blake3 → `Blake3` — ⏳ kernel beats the crate; full pipeline 0.82–0.92×

`Blake3Hash.jl` (the pure-Julia ecosystem package) is scalar — 0.085× the crate. We ported a
`Vec{16,UInt32}` AVX-512 `hash_many`, byte-exact on the official BLAKE3 test vectors **and** against the
crate across the SIMD/reduce path (super-group boundaries, remainders, partial chunks).

- **The compress kernel *beats* the crate — 1.04–1.05×** (pass-1-only, 7.5 vs 7.2 GB/s, single-thread).
  This is the headline: pure SIMD.jl, no assembly, **out-runs `blake3`'s hand-written AVX-512 on the
  hot kernel** — the "language is not the gap" thesis, measured. The earlier docs claimed the compress
  was the bottleneck; direct measurement disproved it.
- **The gap is the tree-reduce orchestration**, not the kernel. The chunk-CV reduction was running at
  *narrowing* SIMD width (8→4→2→1 lanes). Rewriting it to a **full-width (lane = batch) cross-batch
  reduction** — buffer 16 chunk-batches, transpose so lane = batch, run the parent tree 16-wide, fold
  each 256-chunk super-group to one mega-root — cut the orchestration from ~20% to ~8–12% and lifted the
  full pipeline from 0.88× to **0.92× (16 MiB)** / **0.82× (1 MiB**, where the crate is L2-resident and
  most tuned). Byte-exact; per-call `malloc` removed.
- **Remaining gap — proven to be scheduling, not algorithm.** The reduce costs ~6.5% on L1-hot data but
  ~14% at 16 MiB. A faithful **recursive wide-stack reduction** (the crate's `compress_subtree` structure:
  L1-hot 32-chunk groups, 16-wide deinterleave combine) was built and verified byte-exact vs the crate at
  every size — and measured **identical** throughput (0.925× vs 0.930×). So the residual is *not* cache
  eviction or the reduce structure; it's that the reduce runs as a phase **distinct** from compress, fully
  exposed. The crate's last ~5% is fine-grained **interleaving of compress and reduce** across vector ports
  — a scheduling/codegen edge of hand-tuned asm that LLVM won't emit across the `@noinline` kernel calls.
  The kernel itself (the part LLVM *does* control) already beats the crate.

## hashbrown → `SwissDict` — ⚖️ a fundamental trade-off

Reading Base's `dict.jl` reframed this: **Base `Dict` is already a SwissTable** (control bytes = h2,
SoA keys/vals) — only the *probe width* differs (scalar 1-slot vs SIMD 16). We ported a full
`SwissDict{K,V} <: AbstractDict` with a `Vec{16,UInt8}` group probe (TypeContracts-verified interface).

- **Result:** lookup-**miss 2.5× faster** than Base `Dict`; lookup-**hit 1.8× slower**. The SIMD probe
  derives the matching index *from* a reduction, so the value load serializes (no memory-level
  parallelism) — Base's scalar probe knows the address early. The mature `DataStructures.SwissDict`
  (group-aligned, prefetch-tuned) shows the **identical** profile, so it's inherent, not our bug.
- **Verdict:** a *miss-optimized* dict (membership / dedup / set-ops), not a clean win.

## ryu → skip (Base already ships Ryu)

Same DCE bug as itoa, fixed. Fairly, `Base.Ryu.writeshortest` (zero-alloc, Julia ships it) is **2.05×
faster** than the crate on integer-valued floats but **0.76–0.81×** on full-mantissa — value-dependent,
~parity overall. The residual is Base.Ryu's codegen, not the algorithm. Low ROI to port.

## roaring · bumpalo · fxhash · ahash → skip

- **roaring** (compressed bitsets) vs Base `BitSet`: the "38× dense" was build domination. Op-only,
  `BitSet` wins membership at every density (45× even sparse) and dense set-algebra; roaring wins only
  sparse-large union/intersect. Value-dependent — no port.
- **bumpalo** (arena allocator): `Bumper.jl` is the Julia analogue — parity at scale (both
  bandwidth-bound) and **zero GC allocations/call even at 1.1 GB**. No port.
- **fxhash**: Base `hash(::UInt64)` is at parity (0.92×). **ahash**: Base `hash` is **2.83× faster**
  (per-call hasher build dominates the AES advantage). Skip.
